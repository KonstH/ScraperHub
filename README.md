# ScraperHub

A hub which hosts content I am scraping from multiple different websites.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to run the app:

```
node.js
```

### Running the app

To run the app locally:



1. Run `npm install` in the project directory to get all necessary packages


2. Run `node index.js` in the project directory to get the app running on your localhost (`localhost:5000` by default)



## Note

The site has a contact page if you wish to send me feedback, suggestions, tips, ideas, etc.
